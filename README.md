Medical Image Processing

The goal of this project is to learn and implement the complete translational biomedical image processing pipeline for clinical decision support. Specifically, to apply image processing and data mining techniques to cancer histopathological images, and to develop an objective and reproducible decision support for diagnosis and prognosis of cancers.

This course term project was divided into two modules: 
1.1) Automatic segmentation of nuclear structures 
1.2) Image feature extraction and exploration 
2.0) Image classification
