## Dataset 1:
100 digital microscopic images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections of kidney clear cell carcinoma consisting of 100 tumor, 100 necrosis, and 100 stroma sections will be provided.H&E staining enhances three colors:  blue-purple, white, and pink. These colors correspond to specific cellular structures.
