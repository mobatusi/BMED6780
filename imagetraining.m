function results = imagetraining()
% Description
% This function will generate all the mat files that are needed for
% training the images for all datasets. Essentially this mat file will
% contained trainedclassifier for dataset 1,2,3 including any other
% dependencies. The pipeline will call upon variables from this mat file
